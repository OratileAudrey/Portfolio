        Hi! I'm <strong>Audrey Manaleng</strong>, a South African software developer with a passion for clean code, creativity, and continuous growth.
        I'm currently focused on frontend development using Angular, but I'm also gaining experience with Vue and backend development using C# and SQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love learning new things, tackling real-world challenges, and building solutions that are both functional and beautiful. I also enjoy content creation â€” especially documenting my travels, which lets me share meaningful stories with the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I'm an adrenaline-loving solo traveler who's always dreaming of the next adventure. Whether it's exploring mountains, beaches, or forests, I believe in living a full, flexible, and ever-evolving life.
